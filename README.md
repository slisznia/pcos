# Portable, Compact Object Serialization (PCOS)

PCOS is a binary-encoding originally created at PushCoin for inter-application messaging. The serialization is both language and platform neutral. It supports basic types, such as integers, strings and bytes as well as user-defined compound types. User-defined types can nest, forming even more complex types.

PCOS borrows from other binary interchange formats, such that it's schema-based. One major distinction is that PCOS is not a "name-value pair" on the wire, making PCOS very compact and efficient to parse.

PCOS reference implementations for various languages can be found in this repository.

Information which follows outlines the rules for building PCOS messages.

## Primitive types

PCOS serialization supports a range of primitive types. Each one is represented by a reserved keyword and has an associated storage and encoding attributes.  All PCOS messages, including those carrying user-defined types, can be broken down to a series of fields defined solely by these fundamental types:

<table>
<tr> <th>Name</th><th>Serialized Size</th><th>Range</th><th>Description</th> </tr>
<tr> <td>byte</td><td>8-bits </td><td>0 to 255 </td><td>Typically used to store opaque binary data.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>bool </td><td>8-bit </td><td>0 to 1 </td><td>Used for representing Boolean values of True (1) or False (0).</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>int </td><td>variable </td><td>—(2^31) to 2^31 — 1 </td><td>int32 ZigZag encoded signed varint. Varint encoding is described below.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>uint </td><td>variable </td><td>0 to 2^32 — 1 </td><td>unsigned int32 varint.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>long </td><td>variable </td><td>—(2^63) to 2^63 — 1 </td><td>int64 ZigZag encoded signed varint. Varint encoding is described below.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>ulong </td><td>variable </td><td>0 to 2^64 — 1 </td><td>unsigned int64 varint.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>double </td><td>64-bit </td><td>1.7E ± 308 (15 digits) </td><td>IEEE 754 floating point</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>string </td><td>variable </td><td></td><td>uint followed by a UTF-8 encoded byte-string.</td> </tr>
</table>


### Varint datatype

Varints is a space-efficient encoding of integers. Each byte contains the next 7 big-endian bits of the integer. The low bits of the byte store number data with the high bit of the byte used to indicate if another byte is required.

More formally, bits 0 through 6 of the nth octet of the encoded data contain big-endian bits 7*(n-1) through 7*(n-1)+7 of the integer, and bit 7 of the nth octet is set if and only if octet nth+1 is present.

PCOS follows network-byte order for encoding integers. This is in contrast to Google Protobuffers.

PCOS encodes signed varint integers by mapping them to unsigned integers using a zig-zag scheme. Thus, numbers with a small absolute value consume small number of bytes on the wire with just a slight processing overhead.

To zig-zag encode an int32 number, one can apply the following transformation:

```
encode_zigzag32( n ):
        return (n << 1) ^ (n >> 31)
```

To zig-zag encode an int64 number:

```
encode_zigzag64( n ):
        return (n << 1) ^ (n >> 63)
```

Correspondingly, to unwrap a zig-zag number, we apply this transformation:

```
decode_zigzag( n ):
        return (n >> 1) ^ (-(n & 1))
```


### Varint example

Let's have look at the encoding of a number 160 as a signed varint:

```
1000 0010 0100 0000

The application reads one byte at a time, starting with the first octet:
1000 0010
|___more data bit!

It then proceeds to read the second octet, which is also the last octet based
on the MSB value:

0100 0000
|___last octet!

We remember that each following octet fills space of the previous octet shifted
7 bits to the left and having its MSB dropped. Putting it all together, we
have:

# drop MSB of first octet
X000 0010

# shift first octet left 7 bits
0000 0001 0000 0000

# read second octet, drop MSB
X100 0000

# bitwise-OR the octets
      0000 0001 0000 0000
OR               100 0000
=     0000 0001 0100 0000 (320 decimal)

# un-zigzag
decode_zigzag( 320 ) == 160

The last step, un-zigzag, would be omitted if the field was declared unsigned
varint (uint).
```

## Type aliases and user-defined types

PCOS supports user-defined types and type aliases. With the keyword `type` we can assign alternative names to existing types or create composite (user-defined) types.

### Type aliases

Type aliases are user-defined names for existing types. Providing a descriptive name for a type may clarify the purpose of the data, otherwise potentially confusing to the user. It also simplifies the process of changing the underlying data-type of a field, specially if the field exists in many definitions.

To create a type-alias, use the type keyword as follows:

```
type <new-type-name> : <existing type>;
```

Examples:

```
type account_id : uint; // type alias of primitive type
type member_id : account_id; // type alias of another alias
```

Changing the type of a field may break binary compatibility with existing applications which already rely on the previous type. Thus, type aliasing does not ensure backwards compatibility.

## Compound types

Compund types, or user-defined types, are compositions of primitive or user-defined types. There is no limit on nesting of user-defined types.

To create a compound type, use the type keyword as follows:

```
type <new-type-name> { <semicolon-separated list of fields> };
```

Example:

```
  type address
  {
    street : string;  // variable-length character array
    city : string;  // variable-length character array
    zip : byte[5];  // fixed-length byte array
    state_code : string;  // variable-length character array
  };
```

## Arrays

An array is an ordered collection of values. Elements of an array are of primitive or user-defined type. All values stored in the array are of the same type. The type of the array is the type of the values it holds.

### Fixed-length array

An array with a constant size is called a fixed-length array. It's declared as:

```
type <identifier> : <type-of-an-array>[<positive integer>];
```

For example:

```
type checksum : byte[50];
type names : string[7]; # array of 7 strings
type factors : double[7];
```

The fixed-length array has no length indicator on the wire since number of elements is always constant, as defined in the schema.

### Variable-length array

An array that doesn't define an upper limit on it's element count is called variable-length array. It's declared as:

```
type <identifier> : <type-of-an-array>[];
```

For example:

```
type checksum : byte[];
type names : string[];
type factors : double[];
```
 
The variable-length array has the following properties:

* It occupies a variable amount of storage, depending on the number of elements in the array.
* The length indicator is always present on the wire indicating the number of elements in the array.
* The datatype of the length indicator is uint, an unsigned varint. 

## Optional fields

Fields in a data-block can have optional specifier. When a field is marked as optional, it's an indication that a value may not be present on the wire. When serialized, optional fields are prefixed with a bool field indicating if the data is present, followed by the data itself.

Below is an example of a `distance` field declared optional. This field would occupy either 1 byte on the wire, if the value was not present, or 9 bytes if the value was present (double always consumes 8 bytes on the wire).

```
distance : double, optional;
```

## Message Structure

A PCOS message is made of __segments__. The first two segments are mandatory and the last segment is optional:

1. __Message Header__ segment.
2. __Data Block Enumeration__ segment.
3. __Data Block__ segment (zero or more) .

Next, we go over each of the segments explaining its structure and purpose.

### The Message Header segment

The __Message Header__ identifies a PCOS message on the wire. It is a mandatory segment in all PCOS messages and is defined as follows:

```
type message_header
{
  magic : byte[4], const="PCOS";
  flags: byte, const=0; # reserved for future use
  message_id : string;
};
```

### The Data Block Enumeration segment

Following the __Message Header__, starts the mandatory __Data Block Enumeration__ segment. This segment enumerates all (or zero) data blocks — their identifiers and sizes — present in the message. Thanks to the enumeration segment, the receiving side can quickly locate blocks of interest, while skipping blocks it does not care about.

First, we define the data block-meta structure, which describes a single data block:

```
type data_block_meta
{
  block_id : string;
  block_length : uint;
};
```

The Data Block Enumeration is defined as variable-length array of data_block_meta values:

```
type block_enumeration
{
  blocks : data_block_meta[];
};
```

### The Data Block segment

At last, we arrive at the optional segment of the PCOS message — the __Data Block__ segment. All user data, such as transaction or account information, resides in the Data Block segment.

A message may have zero or more data blocks and each data block may have a unique composition of user-defined or primitive types.

### Minimum PCOS message

Putting all this together, let's describe an absolute minimum PCOS message that we can encounter:

```
type pcos_message
{
  # Header (7 bytes):
  #  PCOS(4) + flags(1) + message_id(2) = 7
  header : message_header;

  # empty block enumeration (1 byte for variable-length array size)
  block_enum : block_enumeration;
};
```

Above tells us that the shortest PCOS message, one without any data blocks, is 8 bytes long. This is helpful as any payload shorter than that is simply not a valid PCOS message and can be immediately discarded.
